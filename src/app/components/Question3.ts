// A colleague of yours has written the following code and is requesting your help.
// This code currently doesnâ€™t work as expected; it should print words that are
// palindrome.
// A palindrome is a word (or any sequence) which can be read the same backward
// as forward. Rotor is a palindrome whereas Rater is not.
// Can you find the mistakes and make this code work?

var words: string[] = ["rater", "rotor"];

        return true;
    } else {
        console.log(`${word} is not a palindrome word `)
        return false;
    }
